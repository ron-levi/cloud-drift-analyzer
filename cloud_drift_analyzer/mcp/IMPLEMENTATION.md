# MCP Layer Implementation for AI Agent

This document provides details on the implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) layer for the Cloud Drift Analyzer AI agent integration.

## Implementation Overview

The MCP layer has been implemented with the following components:

1. **Base Tool Infrastructure**: 
   - Defined in `base.py`
   - Provides `Tool`, `ToolRegistry`, and `MCPServer` base classes
   - Includes utility classes for findings and recommendations

2. **Tool Implementations**:
   - Defined in `tools.py`
   - Five specialized tools for cloud infrastructure analysis
   - Each tool handles a specific aspect of cloud consulting

3. **Server Implementation**:
   - Defined in `server.py`
   - Provides a centralized server that registers and manages tools
   - Offers global access functions for tool execution

4. **API Layer**:
   - Defined in `api.py`
   - Exposes MCP functionality via FastAPI
   - Provides HTTP endpoints for remote tool execution

5. **Agent Integration**:
   - Defined in `agent_integration.py`
   - Bridges between AI agents and MCP server
   - Provides LangGraph integration components

## Agent Integration Components

### Core Classes

1. **ToolDescription**:
   - Provides a description of a tool for agent consumption
   - Includes name, description, and schema information

2. **AgentToolRegistry**:
   - Registry of tools that can be used by an agent
   - Helps agent reason about available capabilities

3. **AgentAction**:
   - Represents an action the agent wants to take
   - Specifies the tool and input parameters

4. **AgentActionResult**:
   - Represents the result of an agent action
   - Includes output and any error information

### Integration Classes

1. **AgentMCPInterface**:
   - Main interface between agents and MCP server
   - Provides methods for tool discovery and execution
   - Handles error handling and result formatting

2. **LangGraphExecutor**:
   - Executor for LangGraph workflows
   - Creates tool nodes that can be used in a LangGraph
   - Handles state management between tool executions

### Helper Functions

1. **get_available_tools_for_agent()**:
   - Gets available tools in a format suitable for agent reasoning
   - Simplifies tool discovery for agents

2. **execute_tool_for_agent()**:
   - Executes a tool for an agent
   - Simplifies tool execution and error handling

## LangGraph Integration

The implementation provides integration with LangGraph through the following:

1. Tool nodes that can be added to a LangGraph workflow
2. State management for passing information between nodes
3. Error handling and recovery mechanisms

See `examples/agent_mcp_integration.py` for a complete example of how to use the MCP layer with LangGraph.

## Usage Pattern

The typical usage pattern for an AI agent is:

1. The agent gets a list of available tools and their schemas
2. The agent reasons about which tool to use based on the task
3. The agent executes the selected tool with appropriate inputs
4. The agent receives the result and decides on the next action

All of these steps are facilitated by the MCP layer implementation.

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. Run the example script:
   ```
   python -m cloud_drift_analyzer.examples.agent_mcp_integration
   ```

2. Integrate with an actual LLM + LangGraph implementation:
   - Install LangGraph
   - Initialize the LangGraph executor
   - Create a workflow with the tool nodes
   - Run the workflow with agent reasoning

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements include:

1. Authentication and authorization for tool execution
2. Rate limiting and quota management
3. Additional tools for more specialized cloud consulting tasks
4. Enhanced error handling and recovery mechanisms
5. Improved schema validation and documentation
